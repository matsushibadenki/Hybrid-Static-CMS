# Upgrade Guide

1. Read the release notes and inspect the migration files added since the current version.
2. Back up PostgreSQL with `bun run db:backup`.
3. Back up `public_html`, `storage/uploads`, `templates`, `plugins`, and `.env` using protected storage.
4. Stop the running application or deploy a new application directory beside the old one.
5. Install the locked dependencies with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
6. Run `bun run migrate` before starting the new version.
7. Start the application and verify the control panel, generated artifacts, forms, media, and scheduled publishing.
8. Keep the previous application directory until the rollback window has passed.

Never edit an already-applied migration. Add a new numbered SQL migration for schema changes. A database restore should be followed by `bun run migrate` and an artifact regeneration check.

Migration `016_user_management.sql` adds account activation state, last-login tracking, and password-change tracking. Existing users remain active and keep their current roles after migration.
