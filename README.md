# Hybrid-Static-CMS

Hybrid-Static-CMS is a Bun-powered CMS designed to coexist with an existing `public_html` site instead of replacing it. It lets teams keep legacy HTML/PHP pages, then layer in CMS-driven posts, static fragments, embeddable widgets, and an admin panel under a reverse-proxied control path.

## Why this project exists

- Existing sites can stay in `public_html` as-is.
- The CMS app can live outside public web root in production.
- Content can be consumed in three interchangeable ways:
  - Static HTML fragments for PHP includes and plain HTML sites
  - JavaScript embedding via `/cms/embed.js`
  - JSON APIs under `/cms-api/*`
- Rendering favors pre-generated fragments so normal page views do not need to hit the Bun API.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
bun install
```

2. Copy the environment file and adjust values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Create the PostgreSQL database and run migrations.

```bash
bun run migrate
```

4. Seed a local admin user.

```bash
bun run seed
```

Default seed credentials:

- Email: `owner@example.com`
- Password: `change-me-now`

5. Start the app.

```bash
bun run dev
```

Reverse proxy and deployment notes are documented in `docs/deployment.md`.

## Embedding content

### Static include

```php
<?php include __DIR__ . "/cms/posts/latest.html"; ?>
```

### JavaScript embedding

```html
<div data-hybrid-static-cms-posts data-limit="5" data-category="news"></div>
<script src="/cms/embed.js"></script>
```

### REST API

```txt
GET /cms-api/posts
GET /cms-api/posts/my-first-post
GET /cms-api/pages
GET /cms-api/pages/about-this-site
GET /cms-api/media
GET /cms-api/search?q=hello
```

## Open-source direction

This repository is intentionally generic and keeps the extension surface narrow. Ongoing adopter notes and future setup guidance should be added under `docs/` as the project grows.
